The project aimed to develop a functional ALU capable of performing arithmetic and logical 
operations, leveraging the features and capabilities of the 8086 emulator for simulation and 
testing. The methodology involved careful consideration of design requirements, selection of 
appropriate architectural elements, and implementation using assembly language programming.
